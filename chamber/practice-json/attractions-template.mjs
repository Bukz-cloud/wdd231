/* 
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Replace "ATTRACTION NAME X" with your actual attraction names
2. Replace addresses with real addresses
3. Write unique descriptions for each location
4. Update image filenames to match your actual WebP files
5. Write descriptive alt text for screen readers
6. Save this file as "attractions.mjs" in the data folder
7. Make sure you keep the "export const attractions = [" line at the top!

TIPS:
- Keep names under 50 characters
- Descriptions should be 150-250 characters
- Alt text should describe what's IN the image, not just repeat the name
- Image filenames should match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Don't use special characters in filenames
